**edelweiss**  
after Wislawa Szymborska

we’ll let our lips scar every inch of skin we’ve

ever touched – sin inherited

from tree & still i hope –

imagine the footsteps of the yeti in the

snow. imagine the expedition as the gift

of a person that is more than the sum of

her parts. try to keep me from forgetting.

try to help me forget. you’ll

brand your fingertips into my side but, see

the edelweiss will always bloom anew. & how

lovely it would be if we

could be here again when the ice begins to give

way beneath our feet. maybe this new birth

will be ours this time. maybe at last, among

the shattered blues and whites, the

yeti will hear us rising from the ruins.
