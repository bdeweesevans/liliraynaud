i trace his name, engraved in cold black marble.

i close my eyes  
i feel the desert air  
that desert air that lives  
in me, somewhere

i close my eyes a little harder  
hold the book between my index and my thumb  
i see  
the barbed wire fences  
i hear the siren, its call  
i see the families  
the little girl peeling oranges wondering  
when she’ll see her dad again  
the mother who knows and says nothing  
she buried the family dog under the maple tree  
& left the laughing buddha face down  
in the yard  
that doesn’t belong to them anymore

i understand why he never spoke about it  
i understand why he left it in the dust

what does it mean  
to carry history?  
what does it mean to try and take it in your hand  
and understand it?

to commit to memory  
what was so long forgotten

the tar, the dust, the waiting, the waiting, the waiting  
my elders fought for a country that was keeping their families behind bars  
and they never spoke of it again

(what next?) (we live) (we try to remember)
