it was thursday night

martini
pick

&ensp;&ensp;thru my frontal lobe

we wanted to see the ocean  
half-drunk on a boardwalk lobotomy

the world was big & it was ours

we could’ve swallowed the moon

like a raw scallop  
carved out of its shell with a swiss knife

& split in half  
salty and pure  
we could’ve swum the channel half blind

it’s like  
a sting of the synapses  
like finding layers of truth under this one

1,2,3, tug!

fishbones arent wishbones  
but oh well make do with what you have

ask the genie dripping wet  
where do i go from here

he says nothing  
he says nothing  
then a splash
