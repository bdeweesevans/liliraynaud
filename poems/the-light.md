**the light**

so now we’re in the car    listening to David Gray
& “the whole frosted night is just a song”
        except it’s summer
            and the corn is growing taller by the day
and we both know what it will mean
            when the leafy stalks will be cut loose
like metal    expanding
the house was old and rusty when i was born
now it’s just old
            and the smell of those early days is woven in the walls
staining the air like
                peaches growing old in a basket
    stone  fruit    i think :
i am the stone.
    i am the ant crawling its way back out
        caught by the knife

we will watch the corn grow tall and we will know and say nothing
    & i will eat the stoneless fruit happily.
