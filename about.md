# About Me!

## Bio
Current undergraduate student at NYU majoring in Journalism & Politics, with a minor in Creative Writing. When not in class, can be found at the Village East free member screenings, going for hot girl walks, and trying to read Proust. I owe my love for writing to all those writers who have continually filled my life with wonder, re : Frank O’Hara, Wendy Cope, Wislawa Szymborska, Joni Mitchell, William Carlos Williams, e.e. cummings, Ocean Vuong, Sylvia Plath, Patti Smith, & Richard Siken. (the list goes on).
